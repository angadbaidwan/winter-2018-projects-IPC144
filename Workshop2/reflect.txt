I believe the most important thing that I learned during this workshop was how to evaluate various expressions and calculations in C resulting in the creation of a practical program.
I also learned how to get and store user input as well as print variable values.

It is important to add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing as the compiler does not automatically round up when neccessary. 
For example, 13.478 will be rounded down to 13.47 rather than be appropriately rounded up to 13.48. 
Now adding 0.005 allows the program to round up any GST amount >= 13.475 but < 13.485, for example, to 13.48. 
This means the program will appropriately round up or round down rather than always rounding down.

A casting operation allows the compiler to process a variable as a different variable type for a single time without having to permanently change the variable type which can be useful in certain scenerios.
For example in the workshop, using a casting operation allowed me to display the value stored within the int variable "intBalance" as a decimal with 2 digits of precision.

I believe we were required to use the modulus operator because it showed that there are multiple ways to solve a problem as well as to familiarize ourselves with the modulus operator as it can be easily overlooked but can prove useful or necessary in certain situations.
