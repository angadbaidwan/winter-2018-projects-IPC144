In workshop 1, I first learned how to create a new project and add files to existing projects using visual studio.
I then learned how to write a basic program that prints text using "printf".
I also found out how to test programs using both visual studio and remote host (matrix).
Lastly, I learned how to transfer files to the matrix server and how to submit documents.
