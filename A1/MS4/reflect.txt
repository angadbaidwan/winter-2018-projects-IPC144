Assignment 1
Milestone 4

1) I think the assignment asked to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members because it is a better way to organize code as all of the three structs within "Contact" are related and storing them within a single struct makes the code more readable and easier to work with.

2) The most difficult part of the assignment was working with pointers alongside structs as it was unfamiliar and there were some syntax issues that I had to sort out when trying to store user input into structs using pointers. Overall the lab was a fun learning experience and not too frustrating.

3) It took me about 2 hours to complete Milestone 4.
